This analysis can help the business minimize credit card default risk, increase revenue from interest and fees, and identify profitable customers for targeted marketing.

Problem Statement
By analyzing the factors that influence the setting of a card limit, the bank can benefit in several ways. The analysis can provide valuable insights into customer segments and their creditworthiness, allowing the bank to make informed decisions when determining credit limits. This can help minimize the risk of default by setting appropriate credit limits for different customers based on their income, credit rating, and other relevant factors. Additionally, the analysis can identify potential high-value customers who may be eligible for higher credit limits, enabling the bank to tailor marketing strategies to attract and retain profitable customers. Ultimately, this data-driven approach can lead to improved risk management, targeted marketing efforts, and increased profitability for the bank.
